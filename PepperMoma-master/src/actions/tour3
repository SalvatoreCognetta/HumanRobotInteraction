<*,*,*,*>: This painting portrays the artist sitting on a beat-up couch that has been placed on a street corner ready for trash pickup along with bags of garbageâ€”a familiar sight in New York. Despite his gritty surroundings, Kippenberger assumes a debonair pose, looking into the distance seemingly deep in thought while smoking a cigarette. The work is based on a photograph taken in 1979 during his first trip to the United States from his native Germany.
