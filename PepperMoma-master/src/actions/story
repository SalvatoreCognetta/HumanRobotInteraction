<*,*,*,*>:  Fine! Let me tell you something more about the MoMa: It was founded in 1929, in midtown Manhattan, and was the first museum devoted to the modern era. Today MoMAâ€™s rich and varied collection offers a panoramic overview of modern and contemporary art, from the innovative European painting and sculpture of the 1880s to today's performance art. The collection has grown to include over 150,000 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, photographs, architectural models and drawings, and design objects!
