  abstract = {This paper presents PARADISE (PARAdigm for DIalogue System Evaluation), a general
  framework for evaluating spoken dialogue agents. The framework decouples task requirements
  from an agent's dialogue behaviors, supports comparisons among dialogue strategies,
  enables the calculation of performance over subdialogues and whole dialogues, specifies
  the relative contribution of various factors to performance, and makes it possible
  to compare agents performing different tasks by normalizing for task complexity.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the role of emotion and expressive behavior in regulating social interaction between humans and expressive anthropomorphic robots, either in communicative or teaching scenarios. We present the scientific basis underlying our humanoid robot's emotion models and expressive behavior, and then show how these scientific viewpoints have been adapted to the current implementation. Our robot is also able to recognize affective intent through tone of voice, the implementation of which is inspired by the scientific findings of the developmental psycholinguistics community. We first evaluate the robot's expressive displays in isolation. Next, we evaluate the robot's overall emotive behavior (i.e. the coordination of the affective recognition system, the emotion and motivation systems, and the expression system) as it socially engages nave human subjects face-to-face.}
