\section{Introduction}

Human Robot Interaction is the study of how one or more humans work with one robots in order to accomplish a goal. The Pepper Waiter project was devised to create auch an interaction. 

The main objective of this project was to create a program that allowed to use the Pepper in a bar or restaurant to take your order instead of a human. This idea came to us by thinking of the current global situation and how the less human-to-human contact there is, the better. As such we decided to create a way to adere to the social distancing norms by removing interaction with a human waiter.
